    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "In this three post series, we will demonstrate how to construct the power set of a given source set using two different, but functionally-equivalent, methods. In case you're wondering, the power set of a set $S$ is the collection of all (unique) subsets of $S$, including the empty set and $S$ itself. In order to include subsets as members of the power set, we will define a new object class, `ModSet()`, to encapsulate member sets in \"hashable\" containers.  \n",
    "\n",
    "In part one, we'll use a ~~minimal~~ working example to demonstrate our solution to the subset inclusion problem.  In part two, we construct the `ModSet()` object with all the methods necessary to support power set generation by two distinct approaches. Finally, in part three we develop and run binary mask and recursive routines for generating power sets in Python."

    "## Power sets defined and how to build them\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, a bit about power sets.  \n",
    "\n",
    "If a set $S$ has $n$ elements, its power set will have $2^n$ member subsets; these include the complete \"source\" set, $S$ itself, as well as the empty set, $\\emptyset$. For example, the power set of set $\\{x,y,z\\}$ is: $\\{\\emptyset, \\{x\\}, \\{y\\}, \\{z\\}, \\{x, y\\}, \\{x, z\\},  \\{y, z\\}, \\{x, y, z\\}\\}$. Please notice that there are $2^3=8$ subset elements, all of which are unique; that is, no two subsets contain the same collection of members.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why $2^n$? Because all possible subsets can be formed by selecting their members according to digit occurance in the base-2 integers that count from $0$ to $2^n$ \n",
    "\n",
    "Clear as mud, right? Don't worry, we'll explain."

    "### The Binary Mask approach\n",
    "\n",
    "Say we have a source set comprised of four members, $\\{a,b,c,d\\}$. The corresponding mask will have four digits that can each take on values of either $0$ or $1$. If a mask digit equals $1$ we keep the element in the corresponding location of the source set, if a digit is $0$, we reject the corresponding element. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an illustrative example: binary mask $0101$ operating on source set $\\{a,b,c,d\\}$ would form subset member $\\{b,d\\}$ of the power set.  Similarly, binary mask $1110$ selects subset $\\{a,b,c\\}$. Using the same rule, mask $0000$ selects $\\emptyset$, while $1111$ forms the original source set of all four elements. There are $2^4=16$ unique bit combinations in a 4-digit binary mask, so there are $16$ unique member subsets in the power set of a four-element source set. Now, extending this procedure to a set comprised of $n$ elements rather than $4$, you can see that its power set will have $2^n$ member subsets by the same rule (the binomal theorem).\n",
    "\n",
    "The above procedure may seem to have a certain efficiency and elegance in its directness; one might go so far to say that it is the \"best\" way to generate a power set. In this series, we'll call this method the \"Binary Mask approach\".\n",
    "\n",
    "But there is another method we can use to build power sets..."
   ]
  },
  {
   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "### The Recursive approach\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternatively, you can take your source set, $\\{a,b,c,d\\}$, remove one of its members, $a$, then define a new subset with the members that remain, $\\{b,c,d\\}$, and include it as a new element of the power set. Repeating this process, using all elements on all subsets, you will produce the complete power set of the original source set. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example: removing $b$ from our source set leaves subset $\\{a,c,d\\}$. Removing element $c$ from subset $\\{a,c,d\\}$ leaves subset $\\{a,d\\}$.  Taking $a$ from subset $\\{a,d\\}$ results in subset $\\{d\\}$. And finally, removing element $d$ from subset $\\{d\\}$ results in $\\emptyset$. Then we go all the way back up to the top, this time taking $c$ from $\\{a,b,c,d\\}$ and repeat the entire stripping procedure until we are left with $\\emptyset$ as above. Then do the same starting with members $d$ and $a$; repeating the full stripping procedure for each. Notice that we could have removed any element from any set; a recursive algorithm would remove all elements, one-by-one, from each subset.  Many duplicate subsets will be generated in this process, so enforcing member uniqueness will be critical. \n",
    "\n",
    "This second procedure to generate power sets we'll call the \"Recursive approach\".  While the Recursive approach may lack the directness and efficiency of the Binary Mask procedure, we hope that coding it will at least prove to be a worthwhile, \"chops-building\", exercise in recursion.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we can do either of these, however, we need to investigate the behavior of Python's `set()` class. Specifically, if it suffices for our purposes of containing subsets within an all-encompassing superset, in our case: the power set.\n",

    "\n",
    "In this iterative-based approach, we will populate the power set by applying binary masks to extract out member subsets, one-by-one, from the source set in `ModSet().val`. If you recall, a verbal description of power set generation using a binary mask we discussed way back in part one; you can find it [here](#The-Binary-Mask-approach). Below, we first provide an overview of our binary mask power set generator routine, followed by the routine itself, with heavy commenting, concluded with a detailed walk-through after that.\n",
    "\n",
    "The method, named `.powerSet_bin()`, contains 19 lines and calls `.pushDown()` and `.union()` sibling methods.  Though we could use NumPy here to make mask generation and member extraction more compact, we did not want to confound the comparision (to the recursive approach to follow) by incorporating functionality of an external module.  Already, the code has been somewhat compressed by use of generator expressions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The routine below can be divided into two main blocks: variable initialization, and the run-time loop that builds each binary mask for extracting the corresponding subset on each iteration. The loop populates the powerset member-by-member and terminates when all $2^n$ members have been added. Because indexing is crucial in this approach, you'll notice heavy use of `range()` and `list()` datatypes.  As you'll see later, the recursive approach requires no such crutch."

    "Our recursion-based method for generating powersets contains just 11 lines of code but calls four sibling methods, as well as itself, to run. Though `.powerSet_rec()` has fewer lines than `.powerSet_bin()`, it relies more heavily upon behavior of sibling methods in the `ModSet()` class, i.e. `.__copy__()`, `.pushDown()`, `.diffFunc()` and `.union()` to perform the respective obligatory processing tasks of duplication, nesting, extraction, joining and filtering. Unlike the Binary Mask approach above, indexing is not needed here, and hence, not employed. Through recursion, we can generate the identical power set using thoughtfully-placed set-subtraction, -union and -filtering operations.\n"

If empty, an empty `ModSet()` instance is returned on exit of the routine.

    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "In part one we discussed power sets and their relation to the binary theorem. After some proding, we discovered that Python's `set()` class could not accomodate our need to include sets within sets. To solve the problem, we introduced a custom container class with a set-valued attribute, whose instances are \"hashable\" and thus, eligible for membership in `set` objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "Starting with the container strategy from part one, in part two we expanded our custom class, `ModSet()`, to include methods that perform copying, nesting, uniqueness-filtering, set-union and set-difference operations as well as others.  Several of these additional methods would prove necessary for both methods of power set generation to follow.\n",
    "\n",
    "In part three, we realized our goal of generating power sets. First, we detailed program flow of both the Binary Mask and Recursive approaches of power set generation. The mask routine used list indexing and took more lines of code than recursive method, but called fewer class methods.  The Recursive approach was shorter in terms of lines of code because it incorporated more sibling methods of the `ModSet()` class. Explaining its program flow was \"interesting\" to the least; with effort on the part of the reader, it might strengthen understanding of recursive algorithms. Without effort, it has potential to confuse.  Finally, we compared relative run times of the two approaches. It turned out that, as expected, the Binary Mask routine took less time to run than its recursive counterpart."
